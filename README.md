# ubuntu1604-nist800-171
The script in this repo will be used to apply NIST 800-171 controls to Ubuntu 16.04. This script has been applied to machines running Ubuntu Desktop 16.04 GNOME. At this time I have not developed anything for the Unity GUI to lock it down but may do so in the future.  

# Known Bugs
